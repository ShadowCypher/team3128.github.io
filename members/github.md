[GitHub](http://github.com) is the place where all team information, discussion, and collaboration will occur in the future. Any information that the team needs to know can be found on our organization's GitHub, as well as new projects and code.

Team 3128 has an organization GitHub account, which allows all of the members and mentors to collaborate and view all shared repositories.

#### Info Repository
On our GitHub account, we have an info repository, and the wiki there contains all the necessary information for members and mentors. You don't need a GitHub account to view it, and you can get to it by going to our organization account or [here](https://github.com/Team3128/info/wiki).

#### Joining GitHub
If you would like to contribute to our code, create a GitHub account and ask a mentor, President, or Head of Controls for an invite to join our team's organization.
